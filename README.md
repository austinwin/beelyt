# Beelyt - Habit Tracker
Beelyt App: https://austinwin.github.io/austinwin/  

**Beelyt** (short for Bee-light—habit and discipline like a bee) is a lightweight, privacy-first habit tracker for anyone looking to build better routines.  
It’s fast, mobile-friendly, and works offline—no accounts, no cloud, no tracking.  

I originally built Beelyt for myself, but I’m sharing it in case it helps someone else.  
It’s not packed with features, but it’s yours—simple, private, and always ready.  

## Purpose

Track your habits, mark completions, and jot down daily notes—all in a clean, distraction-free interface. Beelyt helps you build consistency and celebrate progress, one day at a time.

## Features

- **Add, rename, and delete habits**  
- **Mark habits as completed for any day**  
- **View your last 7 days and monthly calendar**  
- **Log notes for each habit**  
- **All data stored locally—your habits, your privacy**  
- **Works offline (PWA support)**  
- **Mobile-first design**

## Data & Privacy

Your data is stored **only in your browser** using localStorage.  
No accounts, no tracking, no cloud sync—your habits and notes never leave your device.

## How It Works

- Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.
- Add habits and start tracking.
- All progress and logs are saved locally.
- You can close the app and return anytime—your data stays safe.

## Installation

No installation required!  
Just open the app in your browser.  
For offline access, add Beelyt to your home screen (PWA support).
