**Key ConsiderationsNo Build Step:** Use Vue.js via CDN (<script> tag) and write plain JavaScript and CSS. This means no Vite, Webpack, or module bundling.
Storage: Use localStorage to store habits (same as before).
PWA: Implement a basic service worker and manifest for offline support and home screen installation.
UI: Use plain CSS (or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS via CDN) for a clean, mobile-first design.
Scalability: Organize code in separate JavaScript files for modularity, even without a build system.
Mobile-First: Optimize for mobile and tablet users with touch-friendly elements.
