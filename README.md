**Beelyt** (short for Bee-light: habit and discipline like a bee) is a lightweight, privacy-first habit tracker for anyone looking to build better routines.  
It’s fast, mobile-friendly, and works offline—no accounts, no cloud, no tracking. Simply open url in browser and add it to your home screen.  

I originally built Beelyt for myself, but I’m sharing it in case it helps someone else.  
It’s not packed with features, but it’s yours—simple, private, and always ready.
